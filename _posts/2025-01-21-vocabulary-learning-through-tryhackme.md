## A friendly tip 
One of the earliest advice that I got when starting to learn about cybersecurity came from my local cyber security meetup group. One of the attendees pointed me to a site called TryHackMe. I have heard about this platform before, being a great beginner resource that offers some CTF style challenges. Now, the guy told me that he reached the top 50 global rankings at one point. That peaked my interest. The site must be good for him to spend that many hours on it. On the train ride back home later that night, I opened up the site.

That was back in late September 2024, and I've been squeezing in a few rooms when I find spare time between my Master's degree and part-time job. At first, it was a messy start. There are free rooms that cover the basics such as networking fundamentals, Linux, basic security concepts, etc. However, the subscription wall made it feel like I am missing out on a lot of knowledge. Or at least, each topic felt a bit incomplete for my liking. I opted in for the premium version after two months after finding out that I get a neat discount from being a student.

## THM's Advent of Cyber
Around that time, the Advent of Cyber (AoC) event was just about to kick off. However, I was going overseas for the Christmas break where I expected inconsistent Internet access. When I did find some idle time, I did try some of the rooms. I am very much a cybersecurity novice, so seeing terms like remote code execution and XXE injections felt like reading words from a foreign language. I went ahead and powered through the rooms regardless and surprisingly found them to be beginner-friendly. It turned out that the AoC event was specifically designed to be sneak peaks on various areas of cybersecurity. If you wanted learn more, they would point you to dedicated rooms that explore those topics more in-depth. I was intrigued by the MITRE ATT&CK framework and Atomic Red Team CTF, so I moved on to those rooms for a while.

## Better late than never
I have been a bit late to the party. Luckily, the AoC rooms are still available to do even after the event ended in December. At the time of writing, I am on day 11 out of day 24, recently just finishing a room about WPA/WPA2 cracking. It is a good educational resource that offers a lot of engagement. The AoC follows the story of Wareville, where you aid characters called Glitch & McSkiddy to stop the evil mayor/mastermind from ruining Soc-mas, their version of Christmas. The extra roleplaying really adds to the fun.

## Learn the vocabulary
If I learned anything from my past roles in finance, it's that major roadblacks to learning industry knowledge come from the lack of vocabulary. Once you learn the words and concepts, it becomes that much easier to engage in people as well as content in that particular domain. For example, if you immerse yourself in the language of finance enough, you'll start using terms such as balance sheets, PE ratio, EBITDA, and profit margins into your conversations. That is the point where your learning reaches lightspeed. In the same way, the AoC event in TryHackMe exposes you to the vocabulary to get you to conversational level. If you are a cybersecurity enthusiast and learner like me, it is worth checking out. Come join me and let's get fluent together.
