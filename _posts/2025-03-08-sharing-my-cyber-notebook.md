## Notes, notes, and more notes
In this learning journey of mine into cybersecurity, I have been taking down some notes along the way. Cybersecurity material is vast and incredibly varied, so you can imagine that the pages stack up quickly. Luckily, my horrible penmanship led to me decide to keep a digital notebook instead. I aptly named it the Cyber Notebook and can be accessed in this [Github repository](https://github.com/ganbuan/CyberNotebook).

As the name suggests, it is a notebook rather than a prescribed textbook or some official publication. Like in most notebooks, it is very rough much like a jungle of information that lacks an overall coherent structure. But it is rich. I suppose the advantage of having everything crammed into a single resource is the availability of quick search. Concepts can be looked up with using the trusty CTRL-F shortcut. Take for example nmap. Doing a quick search will get you a brief description and some command syntax to get you started. Admittedly, you can easily do this by accessing the help option on your terminal, but I found that I save a few more seconds each time using the notebook.

In a nutshell, the Cyber Notebook is and was always meant to be a personal resource that I can use to jog my memory down the road. Cybersecurity is a vast field, and considering that my memory is not something much to brag about, having some notes that I can refer to is highly useful. Trust me, I will be needing it a lot. Back in school, I had some good fortune when it came to friends. They would share their notes to me whenever I was behind or struggle to make sense of the lessons. That saved me quite a bunch of times, and perhaps I am trying to do the same for anyone who needs it. Even if it helps just a tiny bit, I will happily accept that extra bit of good karma.
